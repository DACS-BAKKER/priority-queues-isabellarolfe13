Solver.java (run this file)
Board.java

There are test cases in the solver class that are labeled 
Examples 1-5 and are commented out. These cases consist 
of a few solvable and unsolvable boards so it is easy to test. 
There is also the test client to read in a puzzle from a file but
since we were not given test files we decided it would be 
easier to manually put in board.
